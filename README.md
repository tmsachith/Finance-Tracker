# Finance-Tracker
The objective of the Finance Tracker application is to provide users with a tool for managing their personal finances efficiently. The application should allow users to track their income, expenses, budgets, and generate reports to analyze their financial activities.


·       UserAuthentication: Users should be able to create accounts and log in securely to accesstheir financial data.

·       Reporting:The application should provide various reports such as monthly expensesummaries, income vs. expenses, budget adherence, etc.

·       DataPersistence: All financial data entered by the user should be securely storedand retrievable across sessions.

·       Security:The application should implement robust security measures to protect users'financial information.

**Implementation Details:**

·       Object-OrientedDesign:

Classes: User,Transaction, Category, Budget, Report, etc.

Utilize inheritance andcomposition where appropriate to model relationships between entities.

·       AbstractClasses and Interfaces:

Abstract classes:Transaction (with subclasses for different types like IncomeTransaction,ExpenseTransaction), Report.

Interfaces:DataPersistence (for defining methods related to data storage), Security (fordefining methods related to authentication and authorization). Use existinglibraries to apply security.

·       Threads:

Use threads forbackground tasks such as generating reports asynchronously to avoid blockingthe main UI thread.

·       ExceptionHandling:

Implement exceptionhandling for scenarios like invalid input during transaction entry, databaseerrors during data persistence, authentication failures, etc.
